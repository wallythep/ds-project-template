# Data Science Project Template

This is a template to build out a data science lifecycle project. We're trying to add pieces that match a common data science project workflow. The definition of the steps 
needed varies, but for us the basic ideas are derived from the [MIT Applied Data Science Program][1], which I am taking (March, 2024, cohort).

# Project Layout

Given a lifecycle of Scope, Gather Data, Prepare Data, EDA, Machine Learning, and Measure 
Effect, then we want a section of this project for each step. The contents of each step are of course very different, and for the most part we anticipate that the only template 
material we can do is to provide documentation and project documentation templates. For 
example, to do EDA we may only provide a fairly sparse template notebook with certain 
modules preloaded (like pandas-profiling), and a rudimentary sample set of data profiled.

# Building A Project

We also want to provide various build scripts to allow you to easily take this template, 
and set up your own new data science project from it. Of course, everything provided here 
may not be useful or necessary for each project, so we hope to provide this in descrete 
parts so that you may copy and paste as desired.
